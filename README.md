# ES6-practice
Simple Restaurant Website Project to revise ES6 concepts:
- AJAX XHR requests
- Promises to replace callback
- Async and Await syntax to replace .then() and .catch() in promises
- Importing / Exporting Modules to replace IIFE namespaces
- Template literal syntax
- new "const" and "let" keywords


Also:
- sends GET request to JSON file to load menu items
- uses Bootstrap 5 and custom CSS for styling
- has a fake loadbar on page load, generated with BS5 and AJAX
- injects HMTL into empty divs via js (but isn't a Single Paged App)
- has a butt ton of bootstrap components (was originally boostrap 5 revision)
